Library Management System - Exam Project

Overview – The book bar
For this exam I have developed a web-based application that allows users to interact with a library, enabling them to search for books, borrow and return them, and leave reviews. Additionally, an admin is provided to manage the library’s book collection by adding, updating, and deleting books.
This system is built with a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability. Each service operates independently and communicates with others through synchronous and asynchronous communication. I also used an api gateaway to route api calls and for load balancing.
